Zemeckis is a library to unify the mechanisms for scheduling tasks inside a browser. Browsers support
scheduling of tasks as macroTasks, microTasks, idle tasks, animation tasks etc. This library attempts
to unify the API and often a more consistent mechanism for managing such tasks. For more information
