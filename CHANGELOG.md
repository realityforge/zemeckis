# Change Log

### Unreleased

* Fix the invariant message generated by `Schedule.periodicTask(...)` to indicate that `0` is not a valid period.
* Rename the method `Scheduler.schedule(...)` to `Scheduler.delayedTask(...)`.
* Rename the method `Scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(...)` to `Scheduler.periodicTask(...)`.
* Rework `Scheduler.delayedTask(...)` to call `becomeMacroTask(...)` to wrap supplied task. This will result in tasks scheduled with a delay and tasks scheduled via `Scheduler.macroTask(...)` behaving the same way.
